# Statistics-Tutorials
A repository containing short examples of statistical analysis within R. This is for teaching purposes only. Primary author: Joseph Plummer.

Feel free to use the code from this repository for your own learning purposes or tutorials. The plan is to keep adding to this repository over time, so that we have a decent amount of statistical tutorials. The work here will be presented in the CPIR Trainee Group Seminar.

Contact me (Joey) via joseph.plummer@cchmc.org for any questions.
